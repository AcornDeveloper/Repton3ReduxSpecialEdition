For now, here's a summary of the issue. On Repton 3, spirits are set to move south at the start
of the level; in consequence, a spirit starting with space or earth to its south, east and southeast
will be dazed. This is what prevents many of the AtW/Life/Time levels being playable if loaded in
the Repton 3 game engine.

AtW/Life/Time themselves all have an updated game engine in which spirits' initial movement preference
is more intelligently decided by its environment, so it is impossible for a spirit to start off dazed
unless it's completely surrounded by empty space. This should mean all levels completable in the Repton 3
game engine are also completable if loaded with AtW/Life/Time. The only exception is that spirits with
space on both sides and objects above and below will start off heading the wrong way, which may on some
levels cause them to go into the wrong cage and render the level uncompletable; however, this would be
extremely rare. The only level on which this is known to have a noticeable effect is Finale Screen E,
which if played on the AtW/Life/Time game engine one spirit in the top-left goes in a cage immediately --
but of course the level is still completable.
